        <h5> Exercise 5 </h5>

        <p>
          In Exercise 5, I worked with my teammates Jupiter, Khoa and Nabeeha on the topic of creating pixel characters
          using
          digital meshes. This project focuses on pixel art through digital grids, and I developed it primarily with the
          help of
          grid arrays provided by Nabeeha and Khoa, combined with my creativity and functionality.

          First, I created two 16x16 2D arrays storing string values: “robot” and “red”. These values represent the
          characteristics of each cell in the grid. For example, “robot” represents the shape of the character, while
          “red”
          represents the color of the part. With these values, I can define the attributes of each cell in the grid,
          such as the
          color, shape, and so on.

          Next, I wrote custom functions to dynamically assign colors and shapes to each cell in the grid. These
          functions allow
          each lattice to be given unique visual characteristics based on the string values “robot” and “red”, and
          ultimately to
          be stitched together into complete pixel characters. For example, the “robot” value forms the outline of the
          character
          in the mesh, while “red” defines the color of the part, resulting in a complete pixelated robot character.

          Through this process, I gained insight into how pixel art can be implemented through 2D arrays and numeric
          grids. By
          mapping these grids to visual representations through custom functions, I learned how to control the
          appearance and
          state of each pixel. This process gave me a better understanding of how digital art is constructed and
          improved my
          ability to use arrays and functions to control graphical displays in programming.

          Overall, this assignment not only helped me improve my technical skills in programming, but it also gave me an
          appreciation for how to combine art creation with programming. Through teamwork, we worked together to
          brainstorm and
          combine everyone's creativity and skills to finalize a complete pixel character.<br>

          <h5> Project 3</h5>
          <p>
            In Project 3, I visualized the passage of time through the growth of a tree in the background, accompanied
            by dynamic
            changes in the background color. Every hour, the background color transitions smoothly using the lerpColor()
            function,
            reflecting the continuous flow of time.

            In addition to this, I implemented a ripple effect in the center of the canvas, triggered every hour. This
            effect,
            generated using the ellipse() and fill() functions, consists of gradually expanding circles that represent
            the rhythm
            and flow of time. I used three concentric rings to symbolize the passage of time in seconds, minutes, and
            hours. The
            angle of each ring is dynamically calculated using the map() function based on the current time, ranging
            from 0 to 360
            degrees, to create a progress bar for each time unit.

            Furthermore, each time segment (seconds, minutes, and hours) is associated with a specific activity, which
            is
            represented by a corresponding color and icon. The current activity is determined by mapping the current
            hour (h) to an
            element in the activity array through a simple remainder operation. This mapping shows how the passage of
            time
            correlates with daily human activities.

            Through the tree's growth and the ripple effect, I aimed to represent the irreversibility of time, while the
            multi-ring
            clock visually connects the progression of time to the activities that define daily life.

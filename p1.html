        <h5> Exercise 1 </h5>

        <p>
          For the Wild Wallpaper exercise 1, I gained an understanding of the basics of coding and creating interactive
          images.
          The task involved learning to dynamically modify a graphic's form and design in response to user interactions,
          such as
          adjusting the mouse pointer's position. This allowed me to experiment with various visual effects and
          understand how
          user input influences and controls a graphic's appearance in real time.

          Through this exercise, I explored key programming concepts, including coordinate systems, event-driven
          programming, and
          form manipulation using fundamental geometric principles. These concepts provided a solid foundation for
          understanding
          how to use code to develop engaging, interactive visual content creatively. Furthermore, I discovered how
          responsive
          design elements can enhance the user experience by making interactions more intuitive and visually
          appealing. Reflecting on the experience, I successfully applied these technical and creative skills to produce
          dynamic visuals.
          However, there is room for improvement in refining the complexity and variety of the effects implemented. This
          exercise
          highlighted the potential for combining programming with artistic expression to create unique and responsive
          designs. It
          also underscored the importance of experimentation and iteration in achieving visually compelling and
          user-friendly
          outcomes.<br>

        <h5>Excercise 2</h5>
        <p>
          In exercise 2, the code creates a lively and captivating user experience through an interactive visual effect
          featuring
          dynamic particle effects and colorful rectangular bars on the canvas. The rectangular bars respond to mouse
          movements by
          changing size and color, creating a responsive and fluid design that reacts intuitively to user input. This
          interactivity enhances the overall engagement and provides a sense of connection between the user and the
          visual
          elements.

          By creating colorful particles that travel across the screen and mimic the appearance of motion and depth, the
          particle
          effects offer even another level of dynamic. By simulating natural processes like flowing energy or fireworks,
          these
          particles enhance the rectangular bars and respond dynamically to the mouse's location and movement.

          Each user interaction results in a unique and constantly evolving display, blending motion, color, and
          responsiveness to
          produce a visually rich and engaging environment. The combination of moving bars and interactive particles
          transforms
          the canvas into an immersive space that invites exploration and continuous discovery.

        <h5> Project 1</h5>
        <p>
          In Project 1, I added the capability of painting with various brush forms to the interactive graphic code, so
          expanding
          its capabilities. To do this, I made changes that let users easily swap between different brush types, such as
          squares,
          stars, and circles. By mixing various brush shapes to create original visual compositions, this improvement
          not only
          increases the painting experience's diversity but also inspires users to exercise their creativity.

          The implementation involved designing a user-friendly interface for selecting brush types, which ensures
          smooth
          transitions and intuitive controls. Each brush type was programmed with distinct behaviors to highlight their
          unique
          characteristics. For example, the circular brush creates soft, flowing patterns, while the square brush
          emphasizes
          sharp, geometric lines. The star-shaped brush introduces a playful and dynamic element, adding a sense of
          whimsy to the
          artwork.

          By integrating these features, I learned how to manage code complexity and improve user interaction through
          thoughtful
          design. Additionally, this project provided an opportunity to deepen my understanding of event handling,
          graphical
          transformations, and customization in interactive programming. The resulting tool offers a platform for users
          to
          experiment with diverse artistic expressions, making the interactive graphic code a more engaging and
          versatile creative
          medium.

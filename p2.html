        <h5> Exercise 3 </h5>

        <p>
          In Exercise 3, I learned how to create intricate visual compositions by combining modular programming,
          animation
          effects, visual transformations, and user interactions. Through this project, I experimented with function
          stacking and
          transformation techniques to design characters with dynamic behaviors. One of my key achievements was the
          creation of a
          class called `Bear`, which employs a modular structure of parent and child functions to showcase how dynamic
          visual
          elements and interface design can work together harmoniously.

          The `drawBearBody()` function serves as the main parent function, responsible for rendering the overall
          structure of the
          bear character. Another parent function, `updatePosition()`, updates the character's position and incorporates
          different
          boundary behaviors, such as wraparound and bounce effects. Within this modular framework, `drawEars()`
          functions as a
          child of `drawBearBody()`, tasked with adding details to the bear's face. Additionally, a separate subfunction
          called
          `drawRipple()` is employed to create ripple effects, enhancing the dynamic appeal of the character. The
          exercise also introduced gradient colors to establish a cohesive yellow backdrop theme, which complements the
          dynamic visual elements. Function stacking played a critical role in constructing the bear character, enabling
          a layered
          and visually compelling design. This modular approach not only streamlined the development process but also
          highlighted
          the potential for scalability and future enhancements.

          Looking ahead, I could further refine the character by incorporating more nuanced personality traits and
          behaviors, such
          as interactive responses to user input or additional animations that convey emotions. This exercise deepened
          my
          understanding of how modular programming and layered functions can be leveraged to produce sophisticated,
          interactive
          visual compositions.<br>

        <h5>Excercise 4</h5>
        <p>
          In Exercise 4, I created two main creature objects: the Indy (facial creature) and the Bear (bear). The
          behavior and
          properties of these two objects are supported by the code of the team members. I randomized the initial
          position, size,
          speed, and color of the bear and facial creature in the setup() method. For visual enhancement, I also added a
          background gradient and a clickable ripple effect in the draw() method.

          For the behavior of the bears, I defined their movement, boundary bounce, display and motion control by
          writing the Bear
          class. The appearance, behavior, and mobility of these animals in the interface can be flexibly adjusted.
          Through this
          exercise, I created a virtual habitat containing dynamic animals that combined elements of art and
          programming.

          Through this experience, I learned in-depth about a range of programming concepts and methods such as graphic
          creation,
          interface design, and object-oriented programming (OOP). In particular, I gained a deeper understanding of how
          to create
          art through technology, while significantly improving my programming skills.<br>

        <h5> Project 2</h5>
        <p>
          In Project 2, I explore the mobility of time and space through dynamic shifts and natural materials. This
          piece delves
          into the dualities of nature, with the snowflake symbolizing purity, harmony, and disorder, while the
          recursive tree
          represents life's continuity and the intertwining of regularity and complexity.

          The programming behind this work is rooted in the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, where each
          element, such
          as a snowflake or a tree branch, functions as an autonomous and dynamic "individual." Snowflakes are rendered
          as circles
          using the `ellipse()` function, while tree branches are drawn as lines using the `line()` function. To bring
          the
          composition to life, the `draw()` function cycles through the canvas, animating the elements and creating a
          sense of
          motion and interactivity.

          This implementation encourages critical thinking about the complexities of nature and how digital art can
          encapsulate
          these themes. The recursive nature of the tree branches and the dynamic behavior of the snowflakes illustrate
          the
          balance between order and chaos, regularity and complexity.
